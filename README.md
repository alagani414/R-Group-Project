## Project Overview
This project analyzes **volleyball and beach volleyball performance** at the 2024 Paris Olympics, combining athlete attributes (height, age, gender) with team dynamics and match outcomes. Key goals include:
- Identifying correlations between physical traits (e.g., height) and success üèÜ
- Visualizing regional participation and dominance üåç
- Comparing performance trends between indoor volleyball and beach volleyball üèñÔ∏è

## Data Sources
- **Primary Datasets**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/paris-2024-olympic-summer-games)
  `teams.csv`, `athletes.csv`, `Volleyball.csv`, `Beach Volleyball.csv`

## Data Adjustments
### Key Steps:
1. **Column Selection & Renaming**  
   Focused on participant details, event results, and athlete attributes.
2. **Merging Datasets**  
   Combined team rosters with athlete profiles and match outcomes.
3. **Derived Metrics**  
   Calculated `win_percentage` and handled missing values.
4. **Geospatial Enrichment**  
   Linked countries to geographic coordinates for mapping.

## Analysis & Visualizations
### 1. Geospatial and Statistical Dashboard
- **Scatterplot**: Total matches vs. win percentage (experience correlates with success).  
- **Bar Chart**: Match participation by country (USA leads in total matches).  
- **World Map**: Highlights regional dominance (Americas/Europe vs. underrepresented Africa).

### 2. Parallel Coordinate Plots
- Compared standardized metrics (age, height, wins) across countries.  
- **Key Insight**: Tight age clustering (most athletes are 25-30 yrs), broader win variability.

### 3. Athlete Height Analysis
- **Scatter Plot**: Height distribution by gender.  
- **Country Trends**: Taller nations (Cuba: 202.5 cm avg) don‚Äôt always win more, indicating height isn‚Äôt the sole factor.
